The actualresults are up there for you to see, and I would just like to talk about one importantdevelopment during the quarter and that was the decision of Titan Company to acquirethe stake of our joint venture partner Mithun Sacheti in the CaratLane Private LimitedCompany. And that was decided around the 20 th of August and the work subsequentto tha t is under process.When we partnered with Mithun in 2016 , we had a certain common vision, commondream, and strategy. And I'm very happy to note that partners have ended up achievingthat very well, and I would like to thank Mithun fo r having played his p art in it.As part of the agreement, the purchase of the Mithun stake is happening as per theshareholders' agreement of that time, and we are quite excited to be now in the nextwave of growth . CaratLane, and given the profile of Indian consumers, theirdigitalization, their accessorization, their desiring to buy the right kind of lifestyleproducts, CaratLane is positioned exceedingly well to capitalize on that opportunity.And it would be part of a wholesome portfolio that the Titan's Jewellery business willhave to play with. And all of us are super excited to partner with Avnish Anand, theCEO of CaratLane now, and his team in this next wave of the exciting journey ofCaratLane.So I would like to now stop here and request for all questions relating to the last quarterperformance. Thank you.",

Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store. That's a different kind of audience. The audience is,they are not the same as the earlier one I described. So 2 types of customers, but beyondthat, I don't know what else  I can share.November 03 , 2023",

        "question": "what are expected margins in jewellery business?",
        "answer": "The expected margins in the jewellery business can vary based on several factors, including market conditions, inventory, and competitive intensity. Here are some insights based on recent discussions from industry sources:\n\n1. **General Margin Expectations**:\n   - A consistent margin band for the jewellery division is around **12% to 13%** for the full year.\n\n2. **Factors Affecting Margins**:\n   - **Diamond Prices**: Fluctuations in diamond prices, especially for higher carat solitaires, can impact margins. For instance, a significant drop in diamond prices can lead to margin dilution over several months due to inventory adjustments.\n   - **Gold Prices**: Sudden and significant increases in gold prices can temporarily affect gross margins, especially for studded jewellery, as it takes time to adjust product engineering, design, and sourcing to stabilize margins.\n   - **Competitive Intensity**: High competitive intensity, especially during periods of elevated gold prices, can lead to increased marketing and promotional expenses, which can also impact margins.\n\n3. **Inventory Gains and Losses**:\n   - Inventory gains from price increases ahead of actual cost impacts can temporarily boost margins. Conversely, inventory losses can occur if prices drop after inventory has been stocked at higher prices.\n\n4. **Operational Adjustments**:\n   - Companies often respond to competitive pressures and market conditions with tactical offers, promotions, and marketing investments to maintain market share, which can also influence margins.\n\nOverall, while the jewellery business aims for a margin band of 12% to 13%, actual margins can fluctuate based on market dynamics, inventory management, and competitive strategies.",

Sir,then the second question is, again, on the jewellery business only, on the diamondpricing. There has been -- we understand that there has been a sharp correction indiamond prices. a), could you comment if there is any material impact from thiscorrection on either inventory or margins that you anticipate going forward? That's allfrom my side for now.November 03 , 2023\nanswer: So you are right. Diamond prices, especially in the higher caratages, in  the solitaireside have come down and that's largely to do with international demand -supplysituation , at the moment, supply of solitaires in the market. And we have traditionallynot looked at price corrections based on this situation, but since there ha s been asignificant impact, we have done small corrections in our pricing.And to that extent, that may result in some margin dilution over the next maybe 7, 8months because it's the inventory that we hold that will translate into some degree ofmargin r eduction flowing in. Again, not able to estimate how much that will be in anyquarter, but over the next 6, 7 months, we think there will be.We also don't know whether the prices are likely to continue to remain low or go up.That's something which we are  not able to estimate.  So this is on solitaires and not somuch on rest of the diamond -studded business. And the bulk of what we do is non -solitaire.",

                "message": "question: My first question is on the Jewellery  margin s. So this year, there is a drop of around 140 bps interms of EBIT margins for the full year and 110 bps drop in Q4. In Q3, you had pointed out thatthe competitive intensity has gone up because the gold price spike is there and local players havethat adv antage because they have the inventory, they don't do gold on lease . I wanted tounderstand how are things now? And next year, do you see expansion because there's a dropYoY for the full year, would you expect an expansion next year?\nanswer: Abneesh, Ajoy here. Thanks. So the -- you are aware that last year, anyway, we had someonetime gains on account of inventory gains on diamonds and there was custom duty benefits.So there is that piece. And this year, yes, in the current quarter, there ha s been, let's say, a grossmargin, which is lower than what we would usually deliver in a studded  quarter , studdedintensive quarter.And as mentioned in the presentation, there were 2 reasons for it. One was the payouts o r thecustomer offer s. And competitive intensity continues to be high because the environment --consumer -- let's say, sentiment and environment for business continued to be a little soft. Andtherefore, all players were pretty much pushing for growth.   We also wanted to ensure that wecontinue to deliver the 20% growth that we have kind of now got used to delivering and want tocontinue to deliver. And consequently, w e also responded with appropriate offers andpromotions.May 03 , 202 4In the current period also, there is a fair amount of competitive intensity because the environment-- because of elevated gold prices remain ed soft. It's not that, that has changed. In fact, in April,the gold prices went up even further. It has cooled a little after that, but still higher than what itwas in, let's say, quarter 4.So I think there will be -- this is an ongoing thing. Competitive intensity will continue, and wewill continue to invest in growth and respond accordingly in the marketplace to ensure that wecontinue to gain market share. There was one more reason. I mea n I must -- here upfrontmentioned that one is the consumer offers, but there is also a factor that when gold prices risevery suddenly and significantly because of the weighted average impact on the material cost ofstudded jewellery , it's a combination of diamond cost as well as gold cost.When gold rises up significantly and quickly compared to, let's say, diamond content, there is acertain differential impact on the GC and therefore, the gross margin temporarily get s affected.It takes us a few months thereafter to make some fundamental corrections in either the productengineering or the design or do some changes in the way we are sourcing, etcetera.And then we get the gross margin back up. So in the same vein, it has happened a couple ofyears ago as well. And this year also, this has happened, especially in quarter 4, and it hasextended into April. So we have taken cognizance of that, and we started working on how toreengineer the margins upwards. But it will  take a few months for us to make that correction.

In my opinion, a 2% mix change towards studded should haveresulted into only half of this decline plus there should have been s ome operating leverage aswell. So what are the other growth investments that we are doing which is leading to this kindof a margin decline?\nanswer: So I'm not very sure about the math behind what you said. But the reasons for margin declineare as follows. One is, as you pointed out, studded ratio as studded mix being lower, that iscertainly one of the reasons. The second thing is that there has been  -- and I mean, thecompetitive intensity goes up whenever gold prices rise significantly. So even in Quarter 3, wehave seen gold prices go up 16% year -on-year. And that's the season where everybody is waitingto sell.So naturally, market competitive intensity goes up. And therefore, we've also respondedtactically with offers, with exchange, with the program to protect gold rate for customers, likewe've done earlier on as well. Because for us, ensuring that during the  most important season,we don't lose share. That's the priority. So some amount of payout sits there. And of course,marketing, we have also invested during this quarter.Because there is growing competitive intensity, so we felt it's the right time to put in. So wecontinued our advertising for weddings. We continued besides the festive season. And we alsodid some  work on digital on studded, et cetera. So marketing costs also went up over last year tosome extent. So these are all the top 3 investments that I can think of. I don't know if your mathadds up in your mind.

Secondly, I just wanted to ask, and it's not a question pertaining to the quarter but moreof trends that you've seen in last few quarters, do you think that, at an industry level, there is anaccelerated shift from unorganized to organized, which is  happening? Anyway, see, there was,anyway, a shift happening since many years. But has this shift really materially accelerated?And if so, what are the drivers of that acceleration?Because we are seeing not only you, but many of the other players, at least in the listed space,two or three other stocks, are also reporting fairly high growth numbers. So just from that pointof view, I'm wondering if there is anything to read. So even  the World Gold Council data, whichI see for demand -- of course, they don't include exchange jewellery and all that.But for whatever it is worth, in Q2, that is a September quarter, they have actually, I think, showna slight decline on a Y -o-Y basis in the jewellery demand, whereas I think all the organizedplayers have done very well. So that is the context of the qu estion. So is there any suchaccelerated shift, first of all? And if so, what are the drivers? Is hallmarking a really big driver?And if so, I mean, just your thoughts on that?\nanswer: No, I also think -- I don't have the hard data right now. But overall, if I see the growth and marketshare that we keep tracking for local players and then chains and our own brand, we have beenseeing that as more and more chains are opening across diffe rent parts of the country, the growthrates are different. And therefore, yes, there is some kind of acceleration.And I think with people getting listed and having access to capital, there is greater expansionthat is going on. And some of the other players are wanting to expand, put up stores and thenprobably go for IPO also. So there are both sets of players.  The other piece that I'm --February  01, 202 4therefore, yes to what you are sensing, I also tend to resonate with that, notwithstanding theWorld Gold Council data because their figures are around kgs and grammage and all that stuffand it's too macro to conclude.The second piece is there's another phenomenon that exists that many local players are alsobecoming organized in the way they operate. They may be a one -off store or two or three stores,but they are changing the way they operate in response to the realit y that they are facing. Andtherefore, they are becoming sharper in terms of their customer service, their store ambience,the marketing that they're doing locally or even the kind of services they are offering andtransparency with which they are also doi ng exchange and other things.So I think they've also understood that the name of the game is to become more organized andmore transparent and therefore gain trust. So I think that's the other phenomenon that Tanishqsees. And therefore, I think this is secular and will continue to accelerate.",

But it's not a general comm entary on the level of rents asmuch as the scale that we need to reach.And like I said, when I started, some of the things that we have done in the last 3  - 4 months inthe EyeCare business, particularly give us a lot of confidence about how FY25 is likely to turnout for the medium and the smaller stores. But overall, rent by itself is not something that weworry about.",

So far -- I mean, as on date, we actually have about 13 Tanishqstores. We've just opened , soft launched Singapore. The formal launch is tomorrowand we'll be opening Houston as well tomorrow, and Dallas has opened recently.There's 2 stores that we opened a little while ago in Qatar.

We're getting agood percentage of repeat customers.

It's the firsttime maybe for a span of a few months or quarters you've seen the SSG profile being slightlydifferent between a Tanishq and a CaratLane. So just to understa nd, is it more, in your opinion,a perspective of the different customer segments and how they have been impacted or a lack ofactivations? Or are there any other aspect that you may want to read into looking at, say, the lastnine months?\nanswer: No, I think two things. As I said, in Tanishq, we cannot take the entire Tanishq performance,whether it's in -store or gross and compare it to CaratLane because the price points and segmentsare very different. Then there is a very large gold component als o sitting in Tanishq. So, actually,the studded -- and within Tanishq, the studded, less than INR  1 lakh and less than INR  50,000.And CaratLane is mostly below INR  50,000, the bulk of that. So I think they are not directlycomparable from the  figures you have.And I -- the second piece is CaratLane has added -- they've added lots of stores last year, so --and many of them in the same towns as well. So there is likely to be some pluses and minuseshappening there. In the case of Tanishq, the same -store growth u pside has been -- or betterperformance has been also driven by the gold part of the business in this quarter. So I'm notreading too much into this. I don't think -- and of course, the segments are different.And picking up about which Venkat had shared in the last earnings call that when it comes togold business, every -- it's a question of gaining share because the market is already penetrated.Customers are already buying gold jewellery. But when it comes to studded and that too in thesub INR 50,000, it is the case of market expansion. That segment is getting created as we goalong.And therefore, there is not much share to gain as much as getting more customers into this pipe.And that process doesn't happen overnight. So therefore, the behaviour of that segment versusthe behaviour of the overall Jewellery segment will be different . So in that sense, yes, thecustomer segments are different and the opportunity spaces are different.",

In my opinion, a 2% mix change towards studded should haveresulted into only half of this decline plus there should have been s ome operating leverage aswell. So what are the other growth investments that we are doing which is leading to this kindof a margin decline?\nanswer: So I'm not very sure about the math behind what you said. But the reasons for margin declineare as follows. One is, as you pointed out, studded ratio as studded mix being lower, that iscertainly one of the reasons. The second thing is that there has been  -- and I mean, thecompetitive intensity goes up whenever gold prices rise significantly. So even in Quarter 3, wehave seen gold prices go up 16% year -on-year. And that's the season where everybody is waitingto sell.So naturally, market competitive intensity goes up. And therefore, we've also respondedtactically with offers, with exchange, with the program to protect gold rate for customers, likewe've done earlier on as well. Because for us, ensuring that during the  most important season,we don't lose share. That's the priority. So some amount of payout sits there. And of course,marketing, we have also invested during this quarter.Because there is growing competitive intensity, so we felt it's the right time to put in. So wecontinued our advertising for weddings. We continued besides the festive season. And we alsodid some  work on digital on studded, et cetera. So marketing costs also went up over last year tosome extent. So these are all the top 3 investments that I can think of. I don't know if your mathadds up in your mind.

Inventory gain s came in last yearbecause we took the price increases ahead of the actual costs hitting us because of thepipeline inventory we had.

I wanted tounderstand how are things now? And next year, do you see expansion because there's a dropYoY for the full year, would you expect an expansion next year?\nanswer: Abneesh, Ajoy here. Thanks. So the -- you are aware that last year, anyway, we had someonetime gains on account of inventory gains on diamonds and there was custom duty benefits.So there is that piece. And this year, yes, in the current quarter, there ha s been, let's say, a grossmargin, which is lower than what we would usually deliver in a studded  quarter , studdedintensive quarter.And as mentioned in the presentation, there were 2 reasons for it. One was the payouts o r thecustomer offer s. And competitive intensity continues to be high because the environment --consumer -- let's say, sentiment and environment for business continued to be a little soft. Andtherefore, all players were pretty much pushing for growth.   We also wanted to ensure that wecontinue to deliver the 20% growth that we have kind of now got used to delivering and want tocontinue to deliver. And consequently, w e also responded with appropriate offers andpromotions.May 03 , 202 4In the current period also, there is a fair amount of competitive intensity because the environment-- because of elevated gold prices remain ed soft. It's not that, that has changed. In fact, in April,the gold prices went up even further. It has cooled a little after that, but still higher than what itwas in, let's say, quarter 4.So I think there will be -- this is an ongoing thing. Competitive intensity will continue, and wewill continue to invest in growth and respond accordingly in the marketplace to ensure that wecontinue to gain market share. There was one more reason. I mea n I must -- here upfrontmentioned that one is the consumer offers, but there is also a factor that when gold prices risevery suddenly and significantly because of the weighted average impact on the material cost ofstudded jewellery , it's a combination of diamond cost as well as gold cost.When gold rises up significantly and quickly compared to, let's say, diamond content, there is acertain differential impact on the GC and therefore, the gross margin temporarily get s affected.It takes us a few months thereafter to make some fundamental corrections in either the productengineering or the design or do some changes in the way we are sourcing, etcetera.And then we get the gross margin back up. So in the same vein, it has happened a couple ofyears ago as well. And this year also, this has happened, especially in quarter 4, and it hasextended into April. So we have taken cognizance of that, and we started working on how toreengineer the margins upwards. But it will  take a few months for us to make that correction.

The intensity is expected to remain high as organized players expand rapidly. ([Source](https://www.bseindia.com/stockinfo/AnnPdfOpen.aspx?Pname=053a0123-0143-4181-b688-a0576aca84c1.pdf))\n\n4. **Local and National Competitors**:\n   - Titan tracks 45 to 50 competitors, including local players and national chains. The addition of new stores by competitors does not significantly impact Titan, as the market already has existing players.

The company expects high growth rates in these top income segments as India's per capita GDP increases. ([Source](https://www.bseindia.com/stockinfo/AnnPdfOpen.aspx?Pname=ac2e841a-c6e8-47b4-b804-aff4113bf0b5.pdf))\n\n3. **Wearables and Analog Watches**:\n   - Titan has seen phenomenal growth in Fastrack smartwatches and has gained market share. The company plans to continue growing its wearables business by leveraging its strengths in brands, channels, and technology. For analog watches, Titan is focusing on premiumization and acquiring new customers through new sub-brands.

                "message": "question: Firstly, the income classes where different industries and different companies particularlyoperate would have a great bearing on the question that you're asking. So we're seeing a lot ofslowdown or sluggishness in staples, in motorcycles, whereas cars, p articularly the SUVs andabove , were doing exceedingly well. Titan Company's broad customer base is in the top part ofthe income pyramid. And that has generally played out well for us over the last many years.And the substantial share of jewelry business in our portfolio and jewelry is not an indulgenceproduct, it is a store of value also and in a category where the market share is low and theacceleration of formalization is also happening. So in a way, the performance of Titan Companyover the last many quarters has been better than some of the examples that you're citing. And ina way, it is continuing. If I look at some of the results which has come up in the last couple ofweeks, it continues to reinforce  that.And our own performance in Jewellery in Q3, while it was slightly lower than Q2, it was actuallyoverall strong if you look at the portfolio of Jewellery. Our performance -- sales growthperformance in Watches was also very strong. It's in EyeCare. It's i n same -store growth ofTaneira. It's in the perfumes business. International has been very strong. It's in EyeCare and theother two that we've had some challenges. And these need to be seen -- finally, a quarter is just3 months.So from a lifestyle of a brand, and I'm not here talking about a long li fe-time -- from a 2 -3-yeartime frame, a quarter is still only a quarter. And our overall confidence is very high. And it's acombination of three factors. One is the prediction on the growth in these top income classsegments over the next few years, when we move from INR  2,200 to IN  R5,000 per capita GDP,February  01, 202 4it's actually a very high growth rate of these top two income segments, in fact, even the thirdincome segment. And therefore, you're going to get a tailwind from that.The second is in most of the categories in which we operate, our market share is still singledigits. And combined with the acceleration in formalizing, that's another tailwind that we areseeing. And the third is that our natural behavior and strength in  terms of going deep into Bharatwith all our brands is accelerating, some of the town names I mentioned.So considering all these three things, our overall outlook for medium term, which is FY '25, FY'26, continues to be very strong. We need to become better in managing our operations andextract more value from the scale that we are actually generating.

And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.  Andthere will be more differentiated products with a lot of technology built -in, which will be underthe branding Titan. And this will actually get sold more either in mobile stores or in our TitanWorld stores.  This is for a smaller, more niche group of customers that some people who arereally looking for more features and a better app experience, etcetera. So overall, we see thatbase business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%every year. And this strategic plan leverages our strength of brands, of channels, of technology.We have our own Titan Smart Labs in Hyderabad with more than 80 engineers who are workingon a lot of differentiated products as well as apps.

It's the firsttime maybe for a span of a few months or quarters you've seen the SSG profile being slightlydifferent between a Tanishq and a CaratLane. So just to understa nd, is it more, in your opinion,a perspective of the different customer segments and how they have been impacted or a lack ofactivations? Or are there any other aspect that you may want to read into looking at, say, the lastnine months?\nanswer: No, I think two things. As I said, in Tanishq, we cannot take the entire Tanishq performance,whether it's in -store or gross and compare it to CaratLane because the price points and segmentsare very different. Then there is a very large gold component als o sitting in Tanishq. So, actually,the studded -- and within Tanishq, the studded, less than INR  1 lakh and less than INR  50,000.And CaratLane is mostly below INR  50,000, the bulk of that. So I think they are not directlycomparable from the  figures you have.And I -- the second piece is CaratLane has added -- they've added lots of stores last year, so --and many of them in the same towns as well. So there is likely to be some pluses and minuseshappening there. In the case of Tanishq, the same -store growth u pside has been -- or betterperformance has been also driven by the gold part of the business in this quarter. So I'm notreading too much into this. I don't think -- and of course, the segments are different.And picking up about which Venkat had shared in the last earnings call that when it comes togold business, every -- it's a question of gaining share because the market is already penetrated.Customers are already buying gold jewellery. But when it comes to studded and that too in thesub INR 50,000, it is the case of market expansion. That segment is getting created as we goalong.And therefore, there is not much share to gain as much as getting more customers into this pipe.And that process doesn't happen overnight. So therefore, the behaviour of that segment versusthe behaviour of the overall Jewellery segment will be different .

Suparna, if you could just give us anunderstanding of, firstly, how are you seeing the Wearables to grow now that it's crossed INR100crores top line? How much potential is there? And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.  Andthere will be more differentiated products with a lot of technology built -in, which will be underthe branding Titan. And this will actually get sold more either in mobile stores or in our TitanWorld stores.  This is for a smaller, more niche group of customers that some people who arereally looking for more features and a better app experience, etcetera. So overall, we see thatbase business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%every year. And this strategic plan leverages our strength of brands, of channels, of technology.We have our own Titan Smart Labs in Hyderabad with more than 80 engineers who are workingon a lot of differentiated products as well as apps. And so that's really the plan for Wearables.For analog watches, the growth has been -- continues to be quite goo d. And this is acrosschannels. We have our own EBO s last year doing quite well in large -format stores as well asmarketplace e -com.Premiumization is the big game there. And we are doing very well in brand Titan as well asinternational brands, which are in the higher price points. Quarter 3 was an important quarter,where we broke new ground with the launch of two brands, Vyb from Fas track, which is ofyoung women fast fashion kind of watch sub -brand, and Poze from Sonata, which is the moremass brand, which is for both men and women.And these are offering very good styling and reasonably good quality at very attractive prices.So this has opened up a lot of -- has helped us acquire a lot of new customers at a more affordablereach. So it is, in a way -- again, it's the twin strategy,  acquiring new customers, both fashion -oriented at the lower end and continue to get -- to ride the premiumization wave with highmargins and highly desired brands like Titan at the top .",

So we're seeing a lot ofslowdown or sluggishness in staples, in motorcycles, whereas cars, p articularly the SUVs andabove , were doing exceedingly well. Titan Company's broad customer base is in the top part ofthe income pyramid. And that has generally played out well for us over the last many years.And the substantial share of jewelry business in our portfolio and jewelry is not an indulgenceproduct, it is a store of value also and in a category where the market share is low and theacceleration of formalization is also happening. So in a way, the performance of Titan Companyover the last many quarters has been better than some of the examples that you're citing. And ina way, it is continuing. If I look at some of the results which has come up in the last couple ofweeks, it continues to reinforce  that.And our own performance in Jewellery in Q3, while it was slightly lower than Q2, it was actuallyoverall strong if you look at the portfolio of Jewellery. Our performance -- sales growthperformance in Watches was also very strong. It's in EyeCare. It's i n same -store growth ofTaneira. It's in the perfumes business. International has been very strong. It's in EyeCare and theother two that we've had some challenges. And these need to be seen -- finally, a quarter is just3 months.So from a lifestyle of a brand, and I'm not here talking about a long li fe-time -- from a 2 -3-yeartime frame, a quarter is still only a quarter. And our overall confidence is very high. And it's acombination of three factors. One is the prediction on the growth in these top income classsegments over the next few years, when we move from INR  2,200 to IN  R5,000 per capita GDP,February  01, 202 4it's actually a very high growth rate of these top two income segments, in fact, even the thirdincome segment. And therefore, you're going to get a tailwind from that.The second is in most of the categories in which we operate, our market share is still singledigits. And combined with the acceleration in formalizing, that's another tailwind that we areseeing. And the third is that our natural behavior and strength in  terms of going deep into Bharatwith all our brands is accelerating, some of the town names I mentioned.So considering all these three things, our overall outlook for medium term, which is FY '25, FY'26, continues to be very strong. We need to become better in managing our operations andextract more value from the scale that we are actually generating. Th at is going to be the focuscertainly for the company and all divisions for FY '25.",

Because actually, we track 45 to 50 competitors. Wedon't track one or two national chains. And for us in every market, the local players are as muchan important competitor as much as the national chains. And somet imes local chains are thereas well as independent stand -alone jewelers will also be there.So we track it at city level.

Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store. That's a different kind of audience. The audience is,they are not the same as the earlier one I described.

And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store. That's a different kind of audience. The audience is,they are not the same as the earlier one I described. So 2 types of customers, but beyondthat, I don't know what else  I can share.November 03 , 2023",

Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store.

And I'm very happy to note that partners have ended up achievingthat very well, and I would like to thank Mithun fo r having played his p art in it.As part of the agreement, the purchase of the Mithun stake is happening as per theshareholders' agreement of that time, and we are quite excited to be now in the nextwave of growth . CaratLane, and given the profile of Indian consumers, theirdigitalization, their accessorization, their desiring to buy the right kind of lifestyleproducts, CaratLane is positioned exceedingly well to capitalize on that opportunity.And it would be part of a wholesome portfolio that the Titan's Jewellery business willhave to play with. And all of us are super excited to partner with Avnish Anand, theCEO of CaratLane now, and his team in this next wave of the exciting journey ofCaratLane.So I would like to now stop here and request for all questions relating to the last quarterperformance. Thank you.",

                    "message": "question: Venkat, Ajoy, congratulations. I have a few questions, starting with the main question,which is fundamental question for Ajoy. Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store. That's a different kind of audience. The audience is,they are not the same as the earlier one I described. So 2 types of customers, but beyondthat, I don't know what else  I can share.November 03 , 2023",

                "message": "question: Firstly, the income classes where different industries and different companies particularlyoperate would have a great bearing on the question that you're asking. So we're seeing a lot ofslowdown or sluggishness in staples, in motorcycles, whereas cars, p articularly the SUVs andabove , were doing exceedingly well. Titan Company's broad customer base is in the top part ofthe income pyramid. And that has generally played out well for us over the last many years.And the substantial share of jewelry business in our portfolio and jewelry is not an indulgenceproduct, it is a store of value also and in a category where the market share is low and theacceleration of formalization is also happening. So in a way, the performance of Titan Companyover the last many quarters has been better than some of the examples that you're citing. And ina way, it is continuing. If I look at some of the results which has come up in the last couple ofweeks, it continues to reinforce  that.And our own performance in Jewellery in Q3, while it was slightly lower than Q2, it was actuallyoverall strong if you look at the portfolio of Jewellery. Our performance -- sales growthperformance in Watches was also very strong. It's in EyeCare. It's i n same -store growth ofTaneira. It's in the perfumes business. International has been very strong. It's in EyeCare and theother two that we've had some challenges. And these need to be seen -- finally, a quarter is just3 months.So from a lifestyle of a brand, and I'm not here talking about a long li fe-time -- from a 2 -3-yeartime frame, a quarter is still only a quarter. And our overall confidence is very high. And it's acombination of three factors. One is the prediction on the growth in these top income classsegments over the next few years, when we move from INR  2,200 to IN  R5,000 per capita GDP,February  01, 202 4it's actually a very high growth rate of these top two income segments, in fact, even the thirdincome segment. And therefore, you're going to get a tailwind from that.The second is in most of the categories in which we operate, our market share is still singledigits. And combined with the acceleration in formalizing, that's another tailwind that we areseeing. And the third is that our natural behavior and strength in  terms of going deep into Bharatwith all our brands is accelerating, some of the town names I mentioned.So considering all these three things, our overall outlook for medium term, which is FY '25, FY'26, continues to be very strong. We need to become better in managing our operations andextract more value from the scale that we are actually generating. Th at is going to be the focuscertainly for the company and all divisions for FY '25.",

                "message": "question: Okay, fine. All right. My next question is to Suparna. Suparna, if you could just give us anunderstanding of, firstly, how are you seeing the Wearables to grow now that it's crossed INR100crores top line? How much potential is there? And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.  Andthere will be more differentiated products with a lot of technology built -in, which will be underthe branding Titan. And this will actually get sold more either in mobile stores or in our TitanWorld stores.  This is for a smaller, more niche group of customers that some people who arereally looking for more features and a better app experience, etcetera. So overall, we see thatbase business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%every year. And this strategic plan leverages our strength of brands, of channels, of technology.We have our own Titan Smart Labs in Hyderabad with more than 80 engineers who are workingon a lot of differentiated products as well as apps. And so that's really the plan for Wearables.For analog watches, the growth has been -- continues to be quite goo d. And this is acrosschannels. We have our own EBO s last year doing quite well in large -format stores as well asmarketplace e -com.Premiumization is the big game there. And we are doing very well in brand Titan as well asinternational brands, which are in the higher price points. Quarter 3 was an important quarter,where we broke new ground with the launch of two brands, Vyb from Fas track, which is ofyoung women fast fashion kind of watch sub -brand, and Poze from Sonata, which is the moremass brand, which is for both men and women.And these are offering very good styling and reasonably good quality at very attractive prices.So this has opened up a lot of -- has helped us acquire a lot of new customers at a more affordablereach. So it is, in a way -- again, it's the twin strategy,  acquiring new customers, both fashion -oriented at the lower end and continue to get -- to ride the premiumization wave with highmargins and highly desired brands like Titan at the top .",

Now, frankly, even now Ifind lot of resistance even in the customers to go for lab -grown diamonds, but all saidand done, it's like an IVF baby or a normal baby. Baby remains same. There is nochange.So there is no difference when it comes to lab -grown diamonds versus natural. So doyou think that this will be a major challenge going forward for Titan in the next 3 to 5years? I'm not talking of immediate, but over next 3 to 5 years, do you think that therecould be an impact in the se nse on value?I do understand that there may be some kind of increase in volumes, but would thevalue be impacted because of lab -grown diamonds becoming more and more popular?Because we have seen that in U.S., 50% of loose diamonds now have already -- arealready lab -grown diamonds. And I enquired that the cost of a 1 carat lab -growndiamond is roughly less than $200. So that is why this question.\nanswer: Okay. So first, let me clarify that 50% of the center stone bridal engagement ringproduct, so t hat itself is about 40% of the overall. So that 50% will translate to 20%.Okay, just to clarify that. Second piece, you're right, when the -- if suddenly a retailerdecides to sell a lot of lab -grown diamonds, and because the price of lab -growndiamonds i s contin uously  crashing, in fact, it's crashed very, very badly.And as a consequence, many retailers in the U.S. who were selling both have seen thatthe lab -grown has cannibalized, and now they are having a rethink on their entirestrategy, including the  Signet Group and quite a few other big players. How things willpan out over the next 3 to 5 years in India is difficult to gauge.In the U.S., there is -- the concept of stored value in a diamond is not such a big conceptfor them. And as you can see, i t is largely in this engagement, bridal center stone wherethis phenomenon is occurring, but not in the rest of the fashion jewellery or otherjewellery at least, to the best of our knowledge right now.So in India, the stored value of the diamond, and par ticularly in the solitaires, wherewe are seeing this demand kind of impact in the U.S. In India, the solitaire is beingNovember 03 , 2023bought not for young brides, but it is being bought for milestones.  And a large part ofsolitaire is also investment -led. How this will  pan out therefore the next 3 to 5 years,we don't know. We are keeping a close watch, and we will -- what options we want toexplore as we go forward. We see that there's a big impact, but right now we are notseeing and we'll keep a close watch.",

                    "message": "question: Okay, fine. All right. My next question is to Suparna. Suparna, if you could just give us anunderstanding of, firstly, how are you seeing the Wearables to grow now that it's crossed INR100crores top line? How much potential is there? And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.  Andthere will be more differentiated products with a lot of technology built -in, which will be underthe branding Titan. And this will actually get sold more either in mobile stores or in our TitanWorld stores.  This is for a smaller, more niche group of customers that some people who arereally looking for more features and a better app experience, etcetera. So overall, we see thatbase business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%every year. And this strategic plan leverages our strength of brands, of channels, of technology.We have our own Titan Smart Labs in Hyderabad with more than 80 engineers who are workingon a lot of differentiated products as well as apps. And so that's really the plan for Wearables.For analog watches, the growth has been -- continues to be quite goo d. And this is acrosschannels. We have our own EBO s last year doing quite well in large -format stores as well asmarketplace e -com.Premiumization is the big game there. And we are doing very well in brand Titan as well asinternational brands, which are in the higher price points. Quarter 3 was an important quarter,where we broke new ground with the launch of two brands, Vyb from Fas track, which is ofyoung women fast fashion kind of watch sub -brand, and Poze from Sonata, which is the moremass brand, which is for both men and women.And these are offering very good styling and reasonably good quality at very attractive prices.So this has opened up a lot of -- has helped us acquire a lot of new customers at a more affordablereach. So it is, in a way -- again, it's the twin strategy,  acquiring new customers, both fashion -oriented at the lower end and continue to get -- to ride the premiumization wave with highmargins and highly desired brands like Titan at the top .",

Titan Company's broad customer base is in the top part ofthe income pyramid.

It's the firsttime maybe for a span of a few months or quarters you've seen the SSG profile being slightlydifferent between a Tanishq and a CaratLane. So just to understa nd, is it more, in your opinion,a perspective of the different customer segments and how they have been impacted or a lack ofactivations? Or are there any other aspect that you may want to read into looking at, say, the lastnine months?\nanswer: No, I think two things. As I said, in Tanishq, we cannot take the entire Tanishq performance,whether it's in -store or gross and compare it to CaratLane because the price points and segmentsare very different. Then there is a very large gold component als o sitting in Tanishq. So, actually,the studded -- and within Tanishq, the studded, less than INR  1 lakh and less than INR  50,000.And CaratLane is mostly below INR  50,000, the bulk of that. So I think they are not directlycomparable from the  figures you have.And I -- the second piece is CaratLane has added -- they've added lots of stores last year, so --and many of them in the same towns as well. So there is likely to be some pluses and minuseshappening there. In the case of Tanishq, the same -store growth u pside has been -- or betterperformance has been also driven by the gold part of the business in this quarter. So I'm notreading too much into this. I don't think -- and of course, the segments are different.And picking up about which Venkat had shared in the last earnings call that when it comes togold business, every -- it's a question of gaining share because the market is already penetrated.Customers are already buying gold jewellery. But when it comes to studded and that too in thesub INR 50,000, it is the case of market expansion. That segment is getting created as we goalong.And therefore, there is not much share to gain as much as getting more customers into this pipe.And that process doesn't happen overnight. So therefore, the behaviour of that segment versusthe behaviour of the overall Jewellery segment will be different . So in that sense, yes, thecustomer segments are different and the opportunity spaces are different.",

Quarter 3 was an important quarter,where we broke new ground with the launch of two brands, Vyb from Fas track, which is ofyoung women fast fashion kind of watch sub -brand, and Poze from Sonata, which is the moremass brand, which is for both men and women.And these are offering very good styling and reasonably good quality at very attractive prices.So this has opened up a lot of -- has helped us acquire a lot of new customers at a more affordablereach. So it is, in a way -- again, it's the twin strategy,  acquiring new customers, both fashion -oriented at the lower end and continue to get -- to ride the premiumization wave with highmargins and highly desired brands like Titan at the top .",

Now, frankly, even now Ifind lot of resistance even in the customers to go for lab -grown diamonds, but all saidand done, it's like an IVF baby or a normal baby. Baby remains same. There is nochange.So there is no difference when it comes to lab -grown diamonds versus natural. So doyou think that this will be a major challenge going forward for Titan in the next 3 to 5years? I'm not talking of immediate, but over next 3 to 5 years, do you think that therecould be an impact in the se nse on value?I do understand that there may be some kind of increase in volumes, but would thevalue be impacted because of lab -grown diamonds becoming more and more popular?Because we have seen that in U.S., 50% of loose diamonds now have already -- arealready lab -grown diamonds. And I enquired that the cost of a 1 carat lab -growndiamond is roughly less than $200. So that is why this question.\nanswer: Okay. So first, let me clarify that 50% of the center stone bridal engagement ringproduct, so t hat itself is about 40% of the overall. So that 50% will translate to 20%.Okay, just to clarify that. Second piece, you're right, when the -- if suddenly a retailerdecides to sell a lot of lab -grown diamonds, and because the price of lab -growndiamonds i s contin uously  crashing, in fact, it's crashed very, very badly.And as a consequence, many retailers in the U.S. who were selling both have seen thatthe lab -grown has cannibalized, and now they are having a rethink on their entirestrategy, including the  Signet Group and quite a few other big players. How things willpan out over the next 3 to 5 years in India is difficult to gauge.In the U.S., there is -- the concept of stored value in a diamond is not such a big conceptfor them. And as you can see, i t is largely in this engagement, bridal center stone wherethis phenomenon is occurring, but not in the rest of the fashion jewellery or otherjewellery at least, to the best of our knowledge right now.So in India, the stored value of the diamond, and par ticularly in the solitaires, wherewe are seeing this demand kind of impact in the U.S. In India, the solitaire is beingNovember 03 , 2023bought not for young brides, but it is being bought for milestones.  And a large part ofsolitaire is also investment -led. How this will  pan out therefore the next 3 to 5 years,we don't know. We are keeping a close watch, and we will -- what options we want toexplore as we go forward. We see that there's a big impact, but right now we are notseeing and we'll keep a close watch.",

Or there is some trend which is now Mia isthe different segment which is catering and plain gold Tanishq is catering to a differentsegment?\nanswer: No. I think that's a very simplistic vi ew. Firstly, Mia is present in almost all Tanishqstores also, okay? And in some of -- and in not some, many of the Mia stores, we alsohave kept a Tanishq complementary range of studded products. So you must recognizethat these are 2 channels who are att racting a certain profile of buyers. Secondly, in theTanishq channel also, you get a fair amount of people who come in and buy studdedin the sub -IN R50,000, INR 60,000, both in the Tanishq brand as well as in Mia. Miais mostly 14 -carat. Tanishq is only 18-carat in that studded space. So it would be toosimplistic to classify.What I told you was the large number of people who are sitting and buying -- and whenI say new, this is new to Mia or Tanishq, okay? So the large number of people who areout ther e in the unorganized market who are buying typical gold products, that was thefirst profile I spoke to you about. That is a big chunk. That's a very big chunk becauseof the sheer formalization benefits and the market share gains that we spoke about.The second customer that you are referring to is the new -age customer where there ismore of a market expansion activity and not so much of a share gain, as in newcustomers who are looking at this category as a new acquisition to have for adornment.",

And all of us are super excited to partner with Avnish Anand, theCEO of CaratLane now, and his team in this next wave of the exciting journey ofCaratLane.So I would like to now stop here and request for all questions relating to the last quarterperformance. Thank you.",

Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store. That's a different kind of audience. The audience is,they are not the same as the earlier one I described. So 2 types of customers, but beyondthat, I don't know what else  I can share.November 03 , 2023",

So this, I presume, is mainly for the L3 sell -intiming. So does it mean that we should expect the primary sales to be higher by almost6%-7% in the 3Q to make up for t his gap?\nanswer: No. Let me just clarify. 27% is the growth if you look at the customer price, okay? If Ilook at some amount of discounting etcetera , that 27% growth will actually come downto 26%. And thereafter there is a further 3% drop on account  of timing difference ofupstocking, downstocking this year versus last year.Last year, festive season was in October, so the upstocking happened in September.This year, there was no such upstocking. So therefore  the primary comes down further.In addition to that, there are some adjustment accounting entries, which resulted in thereporting number of NSV .\nanswer: Domestic is 21%, not 20%.\nanswer: Yes.

CaratLane, and given the profile of Indian consumers, theirdigitalization, their accessorization, their desiring to buy the right kind of lifestyleproducts, CaratLane is positioned exceedingly well to capitalize on that opportunity.And it would be part of a wholesome portfolio that the Titan's Jewellery business willhave to play with.

                "message": "question: Firstly, the income classes where different industries and different companies particularlyoperate would have a great bearing on the question that you're asking. So we're seeing a lot ofslowdown or sluggishness in staples, in motorcycles, whereas cars, p articularly the SUVs andabove , were doing exceedingly well. Titan Company's broad customer base is in the top part ofthe income pyramid. And that has generally played out well for us over the last many years.And the substantial share of jewelry business in our portfolio and jewelry is not an indulgenceproduct, it is a store of value also and in a category where the market share is low and theacceleration of formalization is also happening. So in a way, the performance of Titan Companyover the last many quarters has been better than some of the examples that you're citing. And ina way, it is continuing. If I look at some of the results which has come up in the last couple ofweeks, it continues to reinforce  that.And our own performance in Jewellery in Q3, while it was slightly lower than Q2, it was actuallyoverall strong if you look at the portfolio of Jewellery. Our performance -- sales growthperformance in Watches was also very strong. It's in EyeCare. It's i n same -store growth ofTaneira. It's in the perfumes business. International has been very strong. It's in EyeCare and theother two that we've had some challenges. And these need to be seen -- finally, a quarter is just3 months.So from a lifestyle of a brand, and I'm not here talking about a long li fe-time -- from a 2 -3-yeartime frame, a quarter is still only a quarter. And our overall confidence is very high. And it's acombination of three factors. One is the prediction on the growth in these top income classsegments over the next few years, when we move from INR  2,200 to IN  R5,000 per capita GDP,February  01, 202 4it's actually a very high growth rate of these top two income segments, in fact, even the thirdincome segment. And therefore, you're going to get a tailwind from that.The second is in most of the categories in which we operate, our market share is still singledigits. And combined with the acceleration in formalizing, that's another tailwind that we areseeing. And the third is that our natural behavior and strength in  terms of going deep into Bharatwith all our brands is accelerating, some of the town names I mentioned.So considering all these three things, our overall outlook for medium term, which is FY '25, FY'26, continues to be very strong. We need to become better in managing our operations andextract more value from the scale that we are actually generating. Th at is going to be the focuscertainly for the company and all divisions for FY '25.",

Suparna, if you could just give us anunderstanding of, firstly, how are you seeing the Wearables to grow now that it's crossed INR100crores top line? How much potential is there? And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.  Andthere will be more differentiated products with a lot of technology built -in, which will be underthe branding Titan. And this will actually get sold more either in mobile stores or in our TitanWorld stores.  This is for a smaller, more niche group of customers that some people who arereally looking for more features and a better app experience, etcetera. So overall, we see thatbase business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%every year. And this strategic plan leverages our strength of brands, of channels, of technology.We have our own Titan Smart Labs in Hyderabad with more than 80 engineers who are workingon a lot of differentiated products as well as apps. And so that's really the plan for Wearables.For analog watches, the growth has been -- continues to be quite goo d. And this is acrosschannels. We have our own EBO s last year doing quite well in large -format stores as well asmarketplace e -com.Premiumization is the big game there. And we are doing very well in brand Titan as well asinternational brands, which are in the higher price points. Quarter 3 was an important quarter,where we broke new ground with the launch of two brands, Vyb from Fas track, which is ofyoung women fast fashion kind of watch sub -brand, and Poze from Sonata, which is the moremass brand, which is for both men and women.And these are offering very good styling and reasonably good quality at very attractive prices.So this has opened up a lot of -- has helped us acquire a lot of new customers at a more affordablereach. So it is, in a way -- again, it's the twin strategy,  acquiring new customers, both fashion -oriented at the lower end and continue to get -- to ride the premiumization wave with highmargins and highly desired brands like Titan at the top .",

Now, frankly, even now Ifind lot of resistance even in the customers to go for lab -grown diamonds, but all saidand done, it's like an IVF baby or a normal baby. Baby remains same. There is nochange.So there is no difference when it comes to lab -grown diamonds versus natural. So doyou think that this will be a major challenge going forward for Titan in the next 3 to 5years? I'm not talking of immediate, but over next 3 to 5 years, do you think that therecould be an impact in the se nse on value?I do understand that there may be some kind of increase in volumes, but would thevalue be impacted because of lab -grown diamonds becoming more and more popular?Because we have seen that in U.S., 50% of loose diamonds now have already -- arealready lab -grown diamonds. And I enquired that the cost of a 1 carat lab -growndiamond is roughly less than $200. So that is why this question.\nanswer: Okay. So first, let me clarify that 50% of the center stone bridal engagement ringproduct, so t hat itself is about 40% of the overall. So that 50% will translate to 20%.Okay, just to clarify that. Second piece, you're right, when the -- if suddenly a retailerdecides to sell a lot of lab -grown diamonds, and because the price of lab -growndiamonds i s contin uously  crashing, in fact, it's crashed very, very badly.And as a consequence, many retailers in the U.S. who were selling both have seen thatthe lab -grown has cannibalized, and now they are having a rethink on their entirestrategy, including the  Signet Group and quite a few other big players. How things willpan out over the next 3 to 5 years in India is difficult to gauge.In the U.S., there is -- the concept of stored value in a diamond is not such a big conceptfor them. And as you can see, i t is largely in this engagement, bridal center stone wherethis phenomenon is occurring, but not in the rest of the fashion jewellery or otherjewellery at least, to the best of our knowledge right now.So in India, the stored value of the diamond, and par ticularly in the solitaires, wherewe are seeing this demand kind of impact in the U.S. In India, the solitaire is beingNovember 03 , 2023bought not for young brides, but it is being bought for milestones.  And a large part ofsolitaire is also investment -led. How this will  pan out therefore the next 3 to 5 years,we don't know. We are keeping a close watch, and we will -- what options we want toexplore as we go forward. We see that there's a big impact, but right now we are notseeing and we'll keep a close watch.",

And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.  Andthere will be more differentiated products with a lot of technology built -in, which will be underthe branding Titan. And this will actually get sold more either in mobile stores or in our TitanWorld stores.  This is for a smaller, more niche group of customers that some people who arereally looking for more features and a better app experience, etcetera. So overall, we see thatbase business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%every year. And this strategic plan leverages our strength of brands, of channels, of technology.We have our own Titan Smart Labs in Hyderabad with more than 80 engineers who are workingon a lot of differentiated products as well as apps. And so that's really the plan for Wearables.For analog watches, the growth has been -- continues to be quite goo d. And this is acrosschannels. We have our own EBO s last year doing quite well in large -format stores as well asmarketplace e -com.Premiumization is the big game there. And we are doing very well in brand Titan as well asinternational brands, which are in the higher price points. Quarter 3 was an important quarter,where we broke new ground with the launch of two brands, Vyb from Fas track, which is ofyoung women fast fashion kind of watch sub -brand, and Poze from Sonata, which is the moremass brand, which is for both men and women.And these are offering very good styling and reasonably good quality at very attractive prices.So this has opened up a lot of -- has helped us acquire a lot of new customers at a more affordablereach. So it is, in a way -- again, it's the twin strategy,  acquiring new customers, both fashion -oriented at the lower end and continue to get -- to ride the premiumization wave with highmargins and highly desired brands like Titan at the top .",

It's the firsttime maybe for a span of a few months or quarters you've seen the SSG profile being slightlydifferent between a Tanishq and a CaratLane. So just to understa nd, is it more, in your opinion,a perspective of the different customer segments and how they have been impacted or a lack ofactivations? Or are there any other aspect that you may want to read into looking at, say, the lastnine months?\nanswer: No, I think two things. As I said, in Tanishq, we cannot take the entire Tanishq performance,whether it's in -store or gross and compare it to CaratLane because the price points and segmentsare very different. Then there is a very large gold component als o sitting in Tanishq. So, actually,the studded -- and within Tanishq, the studded, less than INR  1 lakh and less than INR  50,000.And CaratLane is mostly below INR  50,000, the bulk of that. So I think they are not directlycomparable from the  figures you have.And I -- the second piece is CaratLane has added -- they've added lots of stores last year, so --and many of them in the same towns as well. So there is likely to be some pluses and minuseshappening there. In the case of Tanishq, the same -store growth u pside has been -- or betterperformance has been also driven by the gold part of the business in this quarter. So I'm notreading too much into this. I don't think -- and of course, the segments are different.And picking up about which Venkat had shared in the last earnings call that when it comes togold business, every -- it's a question of gaining share because the market is already penetrated.Customers are already buying gold jewellery. But when it comes to studded and that too in thesub INR 50,000, it is the case of market expansion. That segment is getting created as we goalong.And therefore, there is not much share to gain as much as getting more customers into this pipe.And that process doesn't happen overnight. So therefore, the behaviour of that segment versusthe behaviour of the overall Jewellery segment will be different . So in that sense, yes, thecustomer segments are different and the opportunity spaces are different.",

There is nochange.So there is no difference when it comes to lab -grown diamonds versus natural. So doyou think that this will be a major challenge going forward for Titan in the next 3 to 5years? I'm not talking of immediate, but over next 3 to 5 years, do you think that therecould be an impact in the se nse on value?I do understand that there may be some kind of increase in volumes, but would thevalue be impacted because of lab -grown diamonds becoming more and more popular?Because we have seen that in U.S., 50% of loose diamonds now have already -- arealready lab -grown diamonds. And I enquired that the cost of a 1 carat lab -growndiamond is roughly less than $200. So that is why this question.\nanswer: Okay. So first, let me clarify that 50% of the center stone bridal engagement ringproduct, so t hat itself is about 40% of the overall. So that 50% will translate to 20%.Okay, just to clarify that. Second piece, you're right, when the -- if suddenly a retailerdecides to sell a lot of lab -grown diamonds, and because the price of lab -growndiamonds i s contin uously  crashing, in fact, it's crashed very, very badly.And as a consequence, many retailers in the U.S. who were selling both have seen thatthe lab -grown has cannibalized, and now they are having a rethink on their entirestrategy, including the  Signet Group and quite a few other big players. How things willpan out over the next 3 to 5 years in India is difficult to gauge.In the U.S., there is -- the concept of stored value in a diamond is not such a big conceptfor them. And as you can see, i t is largely in this engagement, bridal center stone wherethis phenomenon is occurring, but not in the rest of the fashion jewellery or otherjewellery at least, to the best of our knowledge right now.So in India, the stored value of the diamond, and par ticularly in the solitaires, wherewe are seeing this demand kind of impact in the U.S. In India, the solitaire is beingNovember 03 , 2023bought not for young brides, but it is being bought for milestones.  And a large part ofsolitaire is also investment -led. How this will  pan out therefore the next 3 to 5 years,we don't know. We are keeping a close watch, and we will -- what options we want toexplore as we go forward. We see that there's a big impact, but right now we are notseeing and we'll keep a close watch.",

So it's a question about margins, it's not really about the short term. I don'thonestly see that as a miss, it's actually as an investment.So how do we think about the next 12 to 24 months assuming that, let's say, gold stays volatile.Also assuming the relative competitive intensity remains the same. If you could just help usunderstand, in your mind, what are the up elevators and the down e levators as per as marginsare concerned? That's the first question.May 03 , 202 4\nanswer: Thanks, Manoj. You are right. We have made clear choices of pushing for growth and aggressivegrowth. And if margins do take a hit, we are willing to do that. And we've done that consistentlyin the last several quarters as needed. We still ended the year with a fairly healthy 12.3% EBITmargin. And we've been saying consistently. I think both Ashok and I and all of us have beensaying that 12% to 13% is a reasonable expectation to have for the EBIT margin.And annually, I would still say we are staying with that point of view. And we despite pushingfor growth, despite volatility, some pluses and minuses will keep happening all through. So overthe next 12 to 24 months, we would certainly stay consistent wit h that view unless there aresome newer events that emerge. What was the second part of your question?",

So we're seeing a lot ofslowdown or sluggishness in staples, in motorcycles, whereas cars, p articularly the SUVs andabove , were doing exceedingly well. Titan Company's broad customer base is in the top part ofthe income pyramid. And that has generally played out well for us over the last many years.And the substantial share of jewelry business in our portfolio and jewelry is not an indulgenceproduct, it is a store of value also and in a category where the market share is low and theacceleration of formalization is also happening. So in a way, the performance of Titan Companyover the last many quarters has been better than some of the examples that you're citing. And ina way, it is continuing. If I look at some of the results which has come up in the last couple ofweeks, it continues to reinforce  that.And our own performance in Jewellery in Q3, while it was slightly lower than Q2, it was actuallyoverall strong if you look at the portfolio of Jewellery. Our performance -- sales growthperformance in Watches was also very strong. It's in EyeCare. It's i n same -store growth ofTaneira. It's in the perfumes business. International has been very strong. It's in EyeCare and theother two that we've had some challenges. And these need to be seen -- finally, a quarter is just3 months.So from a lifestyle of a brand, and I'm not here talking about a long li fe-time -- from a 2 -3-yeartime frame, a quarter is still only a quarter. And our overall confidence is very high. And it's acombination of three factors. One is the prediction on the growth in these top income classsegments over the next few years, when we move from INR  2,200 to IN  R5,000 per capita GDP,February  01, 202 4it's actually a very high growth rate of these top two income segments, in fact, even the thirdincome segment. And therefore, you're going to get a tailwind from that.The second is in most of the categories in which we operate, our market share is still singledigits. And combined with the acceleration in formalizing, that's another tailwind that we areseeing. And the third is that our natural behavior and strength in  terms of going deep into Bharatwith all our brands is accelerating, some of the town names I mentioned.So considering all these three things, our overall outlook for medium term, which is FY '25, FY'26, continues to be very strong. We need to become better in managing our operations andextract more value from the scale that we are actually generating.

And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.

Now, frankly, even now Ifind lot of resistance even in the customers to go for lab -grown diamonds, but all saidand done, it's like an IVF baby or a normal baby. Baby remains same. There is nochange.So there is no difference when it comes to lab -grown diamonds versus natural. So doyou think that this will be a major challenge going forward for Titan in the next 3 to 5years? I'm not talking of immediate, but over next 3 to 5 years, do you think that therecould be an impact in the se nse on value?I do understand that there may be some kind of increase in volumes, but would thevalue be impacted because of lab -grown diamonds becoming more and more popular?Because we have seen that in U.S., 50% of loose diamonds now have already -- arealready lab -grown diamonds. And I enquired that the cost of a 1 carat lab -growndiamond is roughly less than $200. So that is why this question.\nanswer: Okay. So first, let me clarify that 50% of the center stone bridal engagement ringproduct, so t hat itself is about 40% of the overall. So that 50% will translate to 20%.Okay, just to clarify that. Second piece, you're right, when the -- if suddenly a retailerdecides to sell a lot of lab -grown diamonds, and because the price of lab -growndiamonds i s contin uously  crashing, in fact, it's crashed very, very badly.And as a consequence, many retailers in the U.S. who were selling both have seen thatthe lab -grown has cannibalized, and now they are having a rethink on their entirestrategy, including the  Signet Group and quite a few other big players. How things willpan out over the next 3 to 5 years in India is difficult to gauge.In the U.S., there is -- the concept of stored value in a diamond is not such a big conceptfor them. And as you can see, i t is largely in this engagement, bridal center stone wherethis phenomenon is occurring, but not in the rest of the fashion jewellery or otherjewellery at least, to the best of our knowledge right now.So in India, the stored value of the diamond, and par ticularly in the solitaires, wherewe are seeing this demand kind of impact in the U.S. In India, the solitaire is beingNovember 03 , 2023bought not for young brides, but it is being bought for milestones.  And a large part ofsolitaire is also investment -led. How this will  pan out therefore the next 3 to 5 years,we don't know. We are keeping a close watch, and we will -- what options we want toexplore as we go forward. We see that there's a big impact, but right now we are notseeing and we'll keep a close watch.",

And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.

Titan Company's broad customer base is in the top part ofthe income pyramid. And that has generally played out well for us over the last many years.And the substantial share of jewelry business in our portfolio and jewelry is not an indulgenceproduct, it is a store of value also and in a category where the market share is low and theacceleration of formalization is also happening. So in a way, the performance of Titan Companyover the last many quarters has been better than some of the examples that you're citing. And ina way, it is continuing.

Our performance -- sales growthperformance in Watches was also very strong. It's in EyeCare. It's i n same -store growth ofTaneira. It's in the perfumes business. International has been very strong. It's in EyeCare and theother two that we've had some challenges. And these need to be seen -- finally, a quarter is just3 months.So from a lifestyle of a brand, and I'm not here talking about a long li fe-time -- from a 2 -3-yeartime frame, a quarter is still only a quarter. And our overall confidence is very high. And it's acombination of three factors. One is the prediction on the growth in these top income classsegments over the next few years, when we move from INR  2,200 to IN  R5,000 per capita GDP,February  01, 202 4it's actually a very high growth rate of these top two income segments, in fact, even the thirdincome segment. And therefore, you're going to get a tailwind from that.The second is in most of the categories in which we operate, our market share is still singledigits. And combined with the acceleration in formalizing, that's another tailwind that we areseeing. And the third is that our natural behavior and strength in  terms of going deep into Bharatwith all our brands is accelerating, some of the town names I mentioned.So considering all these three things, our overall outlook for medium term, which is FY '25, FY'26, continues to be very strong. We need to become better in managing our operations andextract more value from the scale that we are actually generating.

It's the firsttime maybe for a span of a few months or quarters you've seen the SSG profile being slightlydifferent between a Tanishq and a CaratLane. So just to understa nd, is it more, in your opinion,a perspective of the different customer segments and how they have been impacted or a lack ofactivations? Or are there any other aspect that you may want to read into looking at, say, the lastnine months?\nanswer: No, I think two things. As I said, in Tanishq, we cannot take the entire Tanishq performance,whether it's in -store or gross and compare it to CaratLane because the price points and segmentsare very different. Then there is a very large gold component als o sitting in Tanishq. So, actually,the studded -- and within Tanishq, the studded, less than INR  1 lakh and less than INR  50,000.And CaratLane is mostly below INR  50,000, the bulk of that. So I think they are not directlycomparable from the  figures you have.And I -- the second piece is CaratLane has added -- they've added lots of stores last year, so --and many of them in the same towns as well. So there is likely to be some pluses and minuseshappening there. In the case of Tanishq, the same -store growth u pside has been -- or betterperformance has been also driven by the gold part of the business in this quarter. So I'm notreading too much into this. I don't think -- and of course, the segments are different.And picking up about which Venkat had shared in the last earnings call that when it comes togold business, every -- it's a question of gaining share because the market is already penetrated.Customers are already buying gold jewellery. But when it comes to studded and that too in thesub INR 50,000, it is the case of market expansion. That segment is getting created as we goalong.And therefore, there is not much share to gain as much as getting more customers into this pipe.And that process doesn't happen overnight. So therefore, the behaviour of that segment versusthe behaviour of the overall Jewellery segment will be different . So in that sense, yes, thecustomer segments are different and the opportunity spaces are different.",

And these need to be seen -- finally, a quarter is just3 months.So from a lifestyle of a brand, and I'm not here talking about a long li fe-time -- from a 2 -3-yeartime frame, a quarter is still only a quarter. And our overall confidence is very high. And it's acombination of three factors. One is the prediction on the growth in these top income classsegments over the next few years, when we move from INR  2,200 to IN  R5,000 per capita GDP,February  01, 202 4it's actually a very high growth rate of these top two income segments, in fact, even the thirdincome segment. And therefore, you're going to get a tailwind from that.The second is in most of the categories in which we operate, our market share is still singledigits. And combined with the acceleration in formalizing, that's another tailwind that we areseeing. And the third is that our natural behavior and strength in  terms of going deep into Bharatwith all our brands is accelerating, some of the town names I mentioned.So considering all these three things, our overall outlook for medium term, which is FY '25, FY'26, continues to be very strong. We need to become better in managing our operations andextract more value from the scale that we are actually generating. Th at is going to be the focuscertainly for the company and all divisions for FY '25.",

                    "message": "question: Okay, fine. All right. My next question is to Suparna. Suparna, if you could just give us anunderstanding of, firstly, how are you seeing the Wearables to grow now that it's crossed INR100crores top line? How much potential is there? And what's the propo sitioning that we are offeringversus the more integrated players and as well on the analog watches  growth ?\nanswer: Yes. So Wearables, we closed last year with more than INR  500 crores turnover at consumerprice level. And this year, we have seen phenomenal growth of Fastrack smartwatches. And thishas been both on our own on -ground channels as well as in marketplace e -commerce. And wehave actually from Quarter 1 to now gained market share. We used to be about 5% -6%. Now weare at 8%, 9%. So we have gained ground. This is on the back of very well -timed good productquality. In fact, our market returns are  among the lowest, very well styled products in theINR1,500 to INR3,500 to INR4,000 range.And we also had a very big campaign with -- in Quarter 2, which kind of gave us a lot of visibilityon Fastrack smartwatches. Going ahead, the game will be played both from Fastracksmartwatches, which will be in that ballpark close to INR  2,000 -3,000 price range, as well as theTitan smartwatches, which will be roughly in the INR  8,000 to INR  15,000 price range.  Andthere will be more differentiated products with a lot of technology built -in, which will be underthe branding Titan. And this will actually get sold more either in mobile stores or in our TitanWorld stores.  This is for a smaller, more niche group of customers that some people who arereally looking for more features and a better app experience, etcetera. So overall, we see thatbase business will almost double in the next -- like continue to grow 80% -- around 70% to 80%every year. And this strategic plan leverages our strength of brands, of channels, of technology.We have our own Titan Smart Labs in Hyderabad with more than 80 engineers who are workingon a lot of differentiated products as well as apps. And so that's really the plan for Wearables.For analog watches, the growth has been -- continues to be quite goo d. And this is acrosschannels. We have our own EBO s last year doing quite well in large -format stores as well asmarketplace e -com.Premiumization is the big game there. And we are doing very well in brand Titan as well asinternational brands, which are in the higher price points. Quarter 3 was an important quarter,where we broke new ground with the launch of two brands, Vyb from Fas track, which is ofyoung women fast fashion kind of watch sub -brand, and Poze from Sonata, which is the moremass brand, which is for both men and women.And these are offering very good styling and reasonably good quality at very attractive prices.So this has opened up a lot of -- has helped us acquire a lot of new customers at a more affordablereach. So it is, in a way -- again, it's the twin strategy,  acquiring new customers, both fashion -oriented at the lower end and continue to get -- to ride the premiumization wave with highmargins and highly desired brands like Titan at the top .",

Now, frankly, even now Ifind lot of resistance even in the customers to go for lab -grown diamonds, but all saidand done, it's like an IVF baby or a normal baby. Baby remains same. There is nochange.So there is no difference when it comes to lab -grown diamonds versus natural. So doyou think that this will be a major challenge going forward for Titan in the next 3 to 5years? I'm not talking of immediate, but over next 3 to 5 years, do you think that therecould be an impact in the se nse on value?I do understand that there may be some kind of increase in volumes, but would thevalue be impacted because of lab -grown diamonds becoming more and more popular?Because we have seen that in U.S., 50% of loose diamonds now have already -- arealready lab -grown diamonds. And I enquired that the cost of a 1 carat lab -growndiamond is roughly less than $200. So that is why this question.\nanswer: Okay. So first, let me clarify that 50% of the center stone bridal engagement ringproduct, so t hat itself is about 40% of the overall. So that 50% will translate to 20%.Okay, just to clarify that. Second piece, you're right, when the -- if suddenly a retailerdecides to sell a lot of lab -grown diamonds, and because the price of lab -growndiamonds i s contin uously  crashing, in fact, it's crashed very, very badly.And as a consequence, many retailers in the U.S. who were selling both have seen thatthe lab -grown has cannibalized, and now they are having a rethink on their entirestrategy, including the  Signet Group and quite a few other big players. How things willpan out over the next 3 to 5 years in India is difficult to gauge.In the U.S., there is -- the concept of stored value in a diamond is not such a big conceptfor them. And as you can see, i t is largely in this engagement, bridal center stone wherethis phenomenon is occurring, but not in the rest of the fashion jewellery or otherjewellery at least, to the best of our knowledge right now.So in India, the stored value of the diamond, and par ticularly in the solitaires, wherewe are seeing this demand kind of impact in the U.S. In India, the solitaire is beingNovember 03 , 2023bought not for young brides, but it is being bought for milestones.  And a large part ofsolitaire is also investment -led. How this will  pan out therefore the next 3 to 5 years,we don't know. We are keeping a close watch, and we will -- what options we want toexplore as we go forward. We see that there's a big impact, but right now we are notseeing and we'll keep a close watch.",

Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store.

And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store.

And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well.

Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains.

And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well.

Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store.

                "message": "question: Venkat, Ajoy, congratulations. I have a few questions, starting with the main question,which is fundamental question for Ajoy. Last many quarters, we have seen a new buyergrowth ahead of 45%. So I was more curious to understand the profile of thesecustomers, what kind of ticket size these people contribute. And what is the frequencyat which the y buy?\nanswer: So I'll just correct you, Shirish. It's not the growth. It's the contribution of what you aretalking, 45%. And even in this quarter, it's a 48% contribution. 48% :52%, new torepeat. So typically there is a difference between a new and a repeat customer. Thenew customer comes in at a lower ticket size, sub -INR 75,000 because they aresampling the brand. Very rarely do they come and buy a very high -value item. Repeatcustomers typically have much higher ticket sizes, and therefore their lifetime value tous is much more.However, the new customer segment is critical because they are the funnel. Over a 3to 4 year period, they migrate from being a sub -INR 75,000 to a INR 2 lakh plus higher,assuming they stay with us and they don't become dormant. So that's the story as itgoes. Profile, well, largely they are typically people who are otherwise buying goldjewellery from somewhere else. And therefore they come in, they wan t gold and theywant gold of their kind.And they're typically the everyday product buyers, whether it's bangles, earrings,fingerings, chains. Over a period of time, then they get attracted towards the studdedside of the business as well. So they are mor e traditional, by and large; not all of them,but by and large, especially in most of the marke st. And two, they are lower ticket size.The metros and the bigger cities, yes, you're also -- we also get a lot of studded buyers,especially those who come in  and buy Mia or a Tanishq, sub -INR 50,000 or even aCaratLane in a CaratLane store. That's a different kind of audience. The audience is,they are not the same as the earlier one I described. So 2 types of customers, but beyondthat, I don't know what else  I can share.November 03 , 2023",
